# Guard::CoffeeScript

Guard::CoffeeScript compiles you CoffeeScripts automatically when files are modified. It is tested on Ruby 1.8.7 & 1.9.2.

## Install

Please be sure to have [Guard](http://github.com/guard/guard) installed before continue.

Install the gem:

    gem install guard-coffeescript

Add it to your `Gemfile`, preferably inside the development group:

    gem 'guard-coffeescript'

Add guard definition to your `Guardfile` by running this command:

    guard init coffeescript

## JSON

The json library is also required but is not explicitly stated as a gem dependency. If you're on Ruby 1.8 you'll need
to install the json or json_pure gem. On Ruby 1.9, json is included in the standard library.

## CoffeeScript

Guard::CoffeeScript uses [Ruby CoffeeScript](http://github.com/josh/ruby-coffee-script/) to compile the CoffeeScripts,
that in turn uses [ExecJS](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs) to pick the best runtime to evaluate the JavaScript.

### node.js

Please refer to the [CoffeeScript documentation](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) for more information about
how to install the latest CoffeeScript version on node.js.

### JavaScript Core

JavaScript Core is only available on Mac OS X. To use JavaScript Core you don't have to install anything, because
JavaScript Core is packaged with Mac OS X.

### V8

To use CoffeeScript on V8, simple add `therubyracer` to your Gemfile. The Ruby Racer acts as a bridge between Ruby
and the V8 engine, that will be automatically installed by the Ruby Racer.

    group :development do
      gem 'therubyracer'
    end

### Mozilla Rhino

If you're using JRuby, you can embed the Mozilla Rhino runtime by adding `therubyrhino` to your Gemfile:

    group :development do
      gem 'therubyrhino'
    end

### Microsoft Windows Script Host

[Microsoft Windows Script Host](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9bbdkx3k.aspx) is available on any Microsoft
Windows operating systems.

## Usage

Please read the [Guard usage documentation](http://github.com/guard/guard#readme).

## Guardfile

Guard::CoffeeScript can be adapted to all kind of projects. Please read the
[Guard documentation](http://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for more information about the Guardfile DSL.

In addition to the standard configuration, this Guard has a short notation for configure projects with a single input a output
directory. This notation creates a watcher from the `:input` parameter that matches all CoffeeScript files under the given directory
and you don't have to specify a watch regular expression.

### Standard ruby gem

    guard 'coffeescript', :input => 'coffeescripts', :output => 'javascripts'

### Rails app

    guard 'coffeescript', :input => 'app/coffeescripts', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled'

## Options

There following options can be passed to Guard::CoffeeScript:

    :input => 'coffeescripts'           # Relative path to the input directory, default: nil
    :output => 'javascripts'            # Relative path to the output directory, default: nil
    :bare => true                       # Compile without the top-level function wrapper, default: false
    :shallow => true                    # Do not create nested output directories, default: false

### Nested directories

The guard detects by default nested directories and creates these within the output directory. The detection is based on the match
of the watch regular expression:

A file

    /app/coffeescripts/ui/buttons/toggle_button.coffee

that has been detected by the watch

    watch(%r{app/coffeescripts/(.+\.coffee)})

with an output directory of

    :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled'

will be compiled to

    public/javascripts/compiled/ui/buttons/toggle_button.js

Note the parenthesis around the `.+\.coffee`. This enables Guard::CoffeeScript to place the full path that was matched inside the
parenthesis into the proper output directory.

This behaviour can be switched off by passing the option `:shallow => true` to the guard, so that all JavaScripts will be compiled
directly to the output directory.

### Multiple source directories

The Guard short notation

    guard 'coffeescript', :input => 'app/coffeescripts', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled'

will be internally converted into the standard notation by adding `(.+\.coffee)` to the `input` option string and create a Watcher
that is equivalent to:

    guard 'coffeescript', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled' do
      watch(%r{app/coffeescripts/(.+\.coffee)})
    end

To add a second source directory that will be compiled to the same output directory, just add another watcher:

    guard 'coffeescript', :input => 'app/coffeescripts', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled' do
      watch(%r{lib/coffeescripts/(.+\.coffee)})
    end

which is equivalent to:

    guard 'coffeescript', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled' do
      watch(%r{app/coffeescripts/(.+\.coffee)})
      watch(%r{lib/coffeescripts/(.+\.coffee)})
    end
